# Project 1: Modeling the population and geography of Senegal and its districts

I chose to examine Senegal because it is a relatively populous developing country in West Africa.
From research I have done I noticed that various businesses and humanitarian groups haave taken an
interest in it due to its rapidly rising population. Therefore, I am really interested about learning
about its development as it represents an important cultural center in West Africa.
