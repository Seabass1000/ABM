# Project 1: Modeling the population and geography of Senegal and its districts

I chose to examine Senegal because, with a population of 16 million, it is a relatively populous
developing country in West Africa. Furthermore, I became very interested in Senegal's development
when I learned through my initial research that various businesses and humanitarian groups have
taken an interest in it due to its rapidly rising population and status as a cultural center in
West Africa. Finally, Senegal contains a sizable amount of both rural and urban areas which I
thought could make for some insightful analysis.

## Creating a Geometric Bar Plot

This graphic consists of a geospatial map of Senegal and its regions with a geospatial map containing
a heatmap that indicates each region's population density; and a geometric bar plot of the percent of
the population of Senegal that is located in each region sorted from highest to lowest.

This graphic shows that the majority of Senegal's population is concentrated in the Dakar and Thies
regions in the west coast where its capital, also named Dakar, and other largest cities are located
while the east side of the country is considerably less populated with kedougou being the least
populated region.
