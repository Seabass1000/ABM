# About me
My name is Sebastian, I was born in Lima, Peru, I enjoy playing videogames, and I have a strong debate background. I am a data science major because it it is at the intersection of my two loves: humanities and data and I believe that it can be used to do many great things. I currently work as a reasearch assistant for the Transparent Development Footprints team at Aid Data and for the Center for Latin American Deveopment at the Global Research Institute. I love to learn and I look forward to learning alot.
